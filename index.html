<p>I've been developing professional websites and web apps since 1996. I've been developing professional mobile apps since 2010 for all iOS & Android Devices (iPhones, iPads, iWatch, Samsung Gear, Home Automation, Auto...). I enjoy involvement with the entire mobile app project : Research, developing, validating ideas, documenting, designing, testing, publishing, marketing, budgeting and planning.</p>

    Native iOS / Objective-C / Swift / XCode
    Native Android / Java / Eclipse / Android Studio
    PhoneGap / Titanium / 
    HTML5 / CSS3 / JS / JQUERY / JQMobile / BootStrap / Node ...
    L.A.M.P. / ROR / 
  </code>

<p>I started developing software when I was a child and have developed solutions with most any popular framework at one time or another.</p>
