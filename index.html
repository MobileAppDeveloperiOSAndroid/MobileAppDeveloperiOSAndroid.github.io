<p><strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/most-wanted/id304154888?mt=8" target="blank">FBI Most Wanted</a></strong> : I updated the old app to help improve it's chances for iTunes Connect Store approval after it had been rejected with other software developers work. I also planned and conducted beta testing before sending it to another developer to publish.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/connecticut-dmv-mobile/id916570063?mt=8" target="blank">CT DMV</a></strong> : I updated the old app to support english and spanish language. I created and managed project documentation with software design documentation, software development milestones, weekly code reviews, testing feedback / recommendations and final project review. I also planned and conducted beta testing before sending it to another developer to publish.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/connecticut-dmv-mobile/id916570063?mt=8" target="blank">Divine Feminine</a></strong> : I hired a remote iOS app developer to create this (native ios, objective-c, xcode) while I was developing other mobile apps. I created and managed project documentation with software design documentation, software development milestones, weekly code reviews, testing feedback / recommendations and final project review. I also planned and conducted beta testing. Finally I am waiting for the artists sign-off so I can publish it to the iTunes Connect Store.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Mohawk 2012 </strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talk-mohawk-2012/id586148719?mt=8" target="blank">for iPhone</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talk-mohawk-2012/id586148719?mt=8" target="blank">for iPad</a>: I created this mobile app from idea to design to development (native ios, objective-c, xcode) to documentation to marketing to publishing. I created and managed project documentation with software design documentation, software development milestones, weekly code reviews, conducting testing, gathering feedback / recommendations and documenting final project review. I also planned and conducted beta testing. I also sought out fluent Kanienkeha speakers and worked with them to create the translations by recording and documenting their words. Finally I published to the iTunes Connect Store, planned & managed an advertising campaign and manage the app today.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
